## Introduction

How much does AI know about understanding and producing graphs? I don't mean
[mathematical graphs](https://medium.com/swlh/how-does-ai-understand-graphs-f7252c8ed8a1) of nodes
and edges. Rather, I mean common graphs of _data_ like bar charts, line graphs, scatterplots
and so forth used to convey information about some topic visually, more promptly to the eye
and brain than can be done with numerical tables.

Nearly all current AI systems use Large Language Models (LLMs), whose simple
description is: 

> a deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing tasks. Large language models use transformer models and are trained using massive datasets â€” hence, large. This enables them to recognize, translate, predict, or generate text or other content."

LLMs have proven to be very good at tasks using text. They can give a reasonable summary of
paper from a PDF, or outline the similarities and differences between the philosophies of
Plato and Aristotle or between behaviorism and cognitive science. They can even be led to
[write poetry about graphs in the style of some poet](https://bsky.app/profile/datavisfriendly.bsky.social/post/3lgcgievyts2k).

But how does this translate to tasks involving _understanding_ of quantitative data displayed
in an _image_ of a graph of data? 

* Can AI correctly interpret the information that is shown in graphs of different types?
* Does it understand the variety of types of charts and the uses in communication for which they are well-suited or fail?
* Given the image a graph and the data, how well can AI reconstruct the graph using software?
* Can it take one attempt at creating a graph, accept criticism, and produce something better able to answer a given design goal?

In a blog post [Using ChatGPT to interpret charts](https://www.descript.com/blog/article/using-chatgpt-data-analysis-to-interpret-charts--diagrams),
Briana Brownell claimed "Got a chart you're having trouble making sense of?  Give it to ChatGPT and it can tell you the main findings from it." With several different type of graphic displays, she found "Overall, I was impressed with its interpretation of the information. But when I tested it on a busy marketing dashboard, cracks began to show."


As an observational, qualitative experiment, I took [Claude 3 Haiku](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) out for a run
with an apparently simple, but provocative graph that appeared on Blue Sky. This was really a two-sided experiment, because
I also wanted to explore how to ask questions of Claude and how to probe his understanding, not
only of the graph, but also his and _my_ learning from a conversation. Thus, he is a co-author on this report.

I should say at the outset that I imagined this as a conversation with an advanced undergraduate who had taken at least a course in applied statistics that taught the uses of various graphic forms and had learned something of using the `ggplot2` package in R for data visualization.
This may have been naive, but that's where I started.

### The topic
In the Blue Sky post that was the origin of my experiment, [Xan Gregg](https://bsky.app/profile/xangregg.bsky.social), a graphics engineer at
SAS Institute, asked a simple question about
a graph that had appeared in the [Daily Tarheel](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2025/01/university-common-data-set)
concerning applicants and the rate of admission to the University of North Carolina (UNC).

![](images/XanGregg-post.png){width=70% height=70%}

### The graph
Here's the graph Gregg posted:

![](images/tarheel-graph.png){width=75% height=75%}

As a presentation-style graph, this is fairly good. It includes a large title describing what the designer
thought it conveyed. Text beneath that rephrases the intended message, and adds details about the percent increase and decrease over time. The graph uses a combination of
bars for the applicants and a line graph for rate of admissions, committing the possible graphic sins
involved in [dual-Y-axis charts](https://policyviz.com/2022/10/06/avoiding-the-dual-axis-chart/). 

But this is not a simple graph because it is trying to show time-series of quantities (number of applications,
rate of admission) that are on different scales, and also mathematically related.

## Working with Claude

Let's see _how_ I can work with Claude on this. A graph in a PNG or JPG image is just an array of pixels,
each one a set of three numbers for red, blue, green components. But what _we_ see is text for the titles, and axis labels, the configuration of bars and lines representing the data values.
The first question is how well Claude can understand the content of a graphic image.

What follows is a transcript of my chat with Claude 3 Haiku, using concise responses
(because I'm on their free plan). I've added brief critiques or comments to some of these.

## Reading the graph
**MF**: _If I upload an image of a graph can you describe it and answer questions about it?_

**Claude**: 
Yes, I can help you with that. I'm capable of analyzing images of graphs, charts, diagrams, and other visual data. 
Please upload the image, and I'll describe its contents and answer any questions you have about it.


**MF**: _(_Uploads the graph_) Here is the graph. Describe to me what this graph is about. What is the topic? What does it show?_

**Claude**: 
This graph is about the trend in first-year applicants and acceptance rates at the University of North Carolina (UNC) from 2019 to 2024.

The key points are:

  - The number of first-year applicants to UNC increased by around 57% from 2019 to 2024.
  - During the same period, the first-year acceptance rate declined from around 23% in 2019 to 16% in 2024.
  - The graph shows the total number of first-year applicants and the acceptance rate over the 6-year period. It demonstrates that as the number of applicants increased significantly, the acceptance rate dropped substantially.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**:
Claude has done a decent job of reading the _text_ in the figure; in particular extracting the summaries of the increases in applicants over 2019 - 2024 and the decrease in acceptance rate.
His _key points_ seem to be a re-phrasing of the subtitle text in the image.
It would be an interesting experiment to remove this text and see what Claude could extract from
the graphic information alone.
:::

## Reflect on the graph

**MF**: _Does this graph mislead in any way? Does it break any standard rules or guidelines for data graphics?_

**Claude**: 
The graph does not appear to mislead or break any standard data visualization guidelines. It clearly presents the trend in first-year applicants and acceptance rates at UNC over the 6-year period. The data is visually displayed in a straightforward manner using common chart types.

The only potential issue I see is that the y-axis scale for the "Total Applicants" line chart may be too narrow, making the year-over-year changes appear more dramatic than they actually are. But overall, the graph effectively conveys the key insights about the increasing applicant numbers and declining acceptance rates at UNC.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: This was a leading question. I wanted to see if Claude recognized the problem with
using separate Y axes for applicants and acceptance rates. He did not. And, the comment about
the Y axis for total applicants being "too narrow" seems wrong. This would have been the case if
the Y axis in the graph had been _truncated_, but it was not.
:::

So, I ask a follow-up question:

**MF**: _Do you think it is a problem that the graph has two Y axes, one for number of applicants and the other for rate of admission?_

**Claude**: 
 The use of dual y-axes in this graph could be problematic. While it allows visualizing both the total applicants and acceptance rate on the same chart, dual axes can make it more difficult to directly compare the two measures. 

The main issue is that the scales are different, so changes in one variable may appear more or less dramatic relative to the other. This could potentially lead to misinterpretations of the relationship between the number of applicants and the acceptance rate.

A better approach may have been to use a single y-axis and plot the acceptance rate as a secondary line or bar chart below the total applicants line. This would allow for a more direct visual comparison between the two metrics.

Overall, the dual y-axis approach is sometimes used but can be problematic if not implemented carefully. A simpler, single y-axis design may have provided clearer insights in this case.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: Claude doesn't initially recognize that the use of two separately scaled Y axes can cause a problem because you can jiggle one of the scales to make the relationship between the two quite different.
When prompted, his "better approach" seems to suggest a different graph, similar to one proposed by [Michiel Duvekot in this thread](https://bsky.app/profile/xangregg.bsky.social/post/3lfznpbs62226). 
But it isn't clear what he means by a 'single axis design." 

![](images/Duvekot2.png){width=75% height=75%}

## Reproduce the graph
How well can Claude interact on this topic by reading data and constructing graphs using `ggplot2`?

**MF**: _If I gave you the raw data, could you reproduce this graph in R using ggplot?_


**Claude**: 
 Certainly, I can reproduce this graph using the raw data in R with ggplot. Provide me with the data and I'll generate the visualization.

**MF**: _Here is the data, in the form of an R expression to read it in to a dataframe:_

```{r UNC-data}
UNC <- read.csv(text =
"year,rate,applicants
2019,22.63,42466
2020,23.54,44382
2021,19.24,53776
2022,16.85,57221
2023,18.74,57902
2024,15.56,66535")
```

**Claude**: 
Understood. Here is the code to reproduce the graph using the provided data:

```{r UNC-claude1}
library(ggplot2)

UNC <- read.csv(text =
  "year,rate,applicants
2019,22.63,42466
2020,23.54,44382
2021,19.24,53776
2022,16.85,57221
2023,18.74,57902
2024,15.56,66535")

ggplot(UNC, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = applicants), color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = rate), color = "darkgreen", size = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Total Applicants",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., name = "Acceptance Rate (Percent)")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "UNC sees drop in acceptance rate as the number of first-year applicants increase",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "darkgreen"),
    axis.title.y.left = element_text(color = "steelblue")
  )
```


This code reads in the provided data, creates a ggplot object, and plots the total applicants on the primary y-axis 
and the acceptance rate on the secondary y-axis. 
The graph is styled with a minimal theme and appropriate axis labels and title.

**Note below the output**: Claude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**:
This is nothing at all like the original. Claude makes two line graphs, one for applications and the other for acceptance
rates, but the right Y axis labels are wrong. 
Technically, Claude does this by using two `geom_line()`s with different `aes(y=)` assignments.

He doesn't recognize that `size` for `linewidth` has been deprecated.
I also down-grade him for only using lines in the time series vs. adding points as well to show
where the data are.

On the other hand, Claude does show some sophistication in coding skills with `ggplot`. He uses
`scale_y_continuous()` to give labels to the left and right axes and `theme()` elements
to set their colors, making the labels match those of the lines.
:::

## Try again

**MF**: _There is a problem here. You've used the same scale for the number of applicants as the rate of admission. And, rate is a percent of applicants. How would you correct this problem?_


**Claude**: 
Got it, let me rework the graph to properly display the applicant numbers and acceptance rate:

```{r UNC-claude2}
ggplot(UNC, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = applicants), color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = rate * 100), color = "darkgreen", size = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Total Applicants",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 100, name = "Acceptance Rate (Percent)")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "UNC sees drop in acceptance rate as the number of first-year applicants increase",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "darkgreen"),
    axis.title.y.left = element_text(color = "steelblue")
  )
```

  
The key changes are:

  - Multiplying the rate column by 100 to properly display the acceptance rate as a percentage.
  - Using `sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 100, name = "Acceptance Rate (Percent)")` to scale the secondary y-axis to match the primary applicant numbers.

This ensures the two metrics are properly aligned and scaled on the graph, making it easy to visually compare the trends in total applicants and acceptance rate.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: Visually, this is not much different from the first attempt, but it is revealing:
**Claude does not understand percents**. The original `rate` variable _is_ a percentage.
Claude wrongly multiplies that value by 100 in `aes(y = rate * 100)` and then tries to fiddle
with this in `scale_y_continuous()`.

In a longer experiment, I would try to see what questions or instructions it would take for 
Claude to get this right.

As well, Claude can't see the resulting graph, so he doesn't recognize that the title has been truncated.
:::

## Different graphs?
The original graph and Claude's (failed) attempts to re-create it were all in the context of
portraying two time series. I asked an open-ended question to see he could come up with a 
different framework for showing this data visually.

**MF**: _Can you think of a different kind of graph to display this information in an understandable way?_


**Claude**: 
An alternative graph type that could effectively display this data is a combination chart with a bar chart for the total applicants and a line chart for the acceptance rate.

This would allow for direct visual comparison of the two metrics on the same scale. The bar chart would clearly show the year-over-year increase in applicant numbers, while the line chart would illustrate the declining acceptance rate.

The key benefits of this approach are:

  - Uses a single y-axis scale for both metrics
  - Separates the presentation of total applicants and acceptance rate for clearer interpretation
  - Bar and line chart combination is a common, intuitive data visualization
  - Providing the data in this format could help make the insights more accessible and easier to interpret compared to the dual y-axis approach in the original graph.


**MF**: _Can you make that graph in R using ggplot?_

**Claude**: 
Understood. Here is the code to create a combination chart with a bar graph for total applicants and a line graph for acceptance rate:

```{r UNC-claude3}
ggplot(UNC, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = applicants), stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_line(aes(y = rate * 100), color = "darkgreen", size = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Total Applicants",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 100, name = "Acceptance Rate (Percent)")
  ) +
  labs(title = "UNC Applicants and Acceptance Rate", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

 
This creates a graph with a bar chart for the total applicants on the primary y-axis and a line chart for the acceptance rate (multiplied by 100 to display as a percentage) on the secondary y-axis. 
The scales are properly aligned, and the chart includes a clear title.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: This is actually closer to the original graph in graphic form, using bars
for applicants and a line graph for the rates, but again the acceptance rates are labeled
wrong and on the wrong scale. 

As well, Claude drops the more descriptive title in favor of something less informative.
:::

## Graphical enhancement
Now, I want to see what Claude can do to enhance this graph, by adding information to make it more
readable or understandable. I chose the simple task of adding numerical labels.

**MF**: _Can you redo that graph putting text labels showing the numerical values of applicants and acceptance rate on the bars and lines?_

**Claude**: 
This code adds text labels to the bars for total applicants and the line for acceptance rate. The applicant numbers are formatted with commas, and the acceptance rate is shown as a percentage rounded to 2 decimal places.

```{r UNC-claude4}
ggplot(UNC, aes(x = year)) +
 geom_bar(aes(y = applicants), stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
 geom_text(aes(y = applicants, label = format(applicants, big.mark = ",")), vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
 geom_line(aes(y = rate * 100), color = "darkgreen", size = 1.2) +
 geom_text(aes(y = rate * 100, label = paste0(round(rate * 100, 2), "%")), vjust = 1.5, size = 4, color = "darkgreen") +
 scale_y_continuous(
   name = "Total Applicants",
   sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 100, name = "Acceptance Rate (Percent)")
 ) +
 labs(title = "UNC Applicants and Acceptance Rate", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: Claude shows some reasonable skills using `geom_text()` to accomplish this. He understands the use of `format()` and `paste()` within the `label` argument, and `vjust` to offset the vertical
position. He still doesn't understand the problem with the graphing and display of acceptance rates.
He doesn't understand that the printed rates are obscured by the bars.
:::


## Grading
Now, I want to ask Claude to self-reflect on his performance so far, and see if he can do better given some feedback, in the form of a grade and comments on what he could have done better or differently.

**MF**: _If I was grading your work for accuracy and understanding so far, what grade do you think you deserve, on a scale of 0 - 100?_

**Claude**: 
I would give myself a grade of 85 out of 100 for the work so far. I was able to accurately reproduce the original graph using the provided data, and then modify the visualization to improve the presentation of the data. However, I could have done a better job anticipating potential issues with the original graph design, such as the use of dual y-axes. Additionally, while the final combined bar and line chart is effective, I could have explored additional graph types that may have been even more intuitive for this data. Overall, I believe I demonstrated a strong understanding of data visualization best practices, but there is still room for improvement in my analytical thinking and creative problem-solving skills.

**MF**: _Well, I would give you 95 for your skills with ggplot. You know about the relevant geoms and scales, and showed good use of techniques for formatting with `geom_text()`. But I would give you only 60-65 for your understanding of rates and percents. The rates acceptance rates (percent) on your right axis go from 0 to 600. The text labels on the line chart start at 2263% and go to 1556%. These are clearly wrong. Can you correct this?_

**Claude**: 
You're right, my previous handling of the acceptance rate percentage was incorrect. Let me revise the graph to properly display the acceptance rate:

```{r UNC-claude5}
ggplot(UNC, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = applicants), stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(y = applicants, label = format(applicants, big.mark = ",")), vjust = -0.5, size = 4) +
  geom_line(aes(y = rate * 100), color = "darkgreen", size = 1.2) +
  geom_text(aes(y = rate * 100, label = paste0(round(rate, 2) * 100, "%")), vjust = 1.5, size = 4, color = "darkgreen") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Total Applicants",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., name = "Acceptance Rate (Percent)", breaks = seq(0, 25, 5))
  ) +
  labs(title = "UNC Applicants and Acceptance Rate", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```


The key changes are:

  1. Correctly displaying the acceptance rate as a percentage by multiplying the rate column by 100 in the geom_text layer.
  2. Adjusting the secondary y-axis scale to show the acceptance rate from 0% to 25% in 5% increments, which is a more appropriate range.

This should now accurately represent both the total applicants and the acceptance rate percentage in the combined bar and line chart.

## Understanding the variables involved

**MF**: _The number of applicants and acceptance rate gives you the number of students accepted. Calculate this and then try to come up with another kind of graph to show what is going on here better._

**Claude**: Understood. Let's calculate the number of students accepted based on the applicant numbers and acceptance rates, then explore a different type of visualization.
The number of students accepted each year can be calculated as:

 	* 2019: 42,466 applicants * 22.63% acceptance rate = 9,605 accepted
 	* 2020: 44,382 applicants * 23.54% acceptance rate = 10,451 accepted
 	* 2021: 53,776 applicants * 19.24% acceptance rate = 10,345 accepted
 	* 2022: 57,221 applicants * 16.85% acceptance rate = 9,641 accepted
 	* 2023: 57,902 applicants * 18.74% acceptance rate = 10,848 accepted
 	* 2024: 66,535 applicants * 15.56% acceptance rate = 10,357 accepted

To visualize this data, a line chart showing the number of students accepted over time could be effective:

```{r UNC-claude6}
ggplot(UNC, aes(x = year, y = applicants * rate)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Students Accepted") +
  labs(title = "UNC Students Accepted Over Time", x = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

  
This graph directly shows the number of students accepted each year, highlighting the fluctuations despite the overall increase in applicants. 
It provides a clearer picture of the admissions trends compared to the previous visualizations.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: Claude understands that `admitted = applicants * rate`, but doesn't think to
calculate this in the data frame or to use this in a graph that shows more than just the number of
students accepted.
:::

## Scatterplot

**MF**: _Can you make a scatterplot of these data? What would be the best variables to plot?_


**Claude**: 
Understood. Let's create a scatterplot to visualize the data.

The best variables to plot would be:

  - Total Applicants on the x-axis
  - Students Accepted on the y-axis

This would allow us to see the relationship between the number of applicants and the number of students accepted over the years.

```{r UNC-claude7}
ggplot(UNC, aes(x = applicants, y = applicants * rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Total Applicants") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Students Accepted") +
  labs(title = "UNC Applicants vs Students Accepted") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: Claude appropriately selected applicants and accepted as the best variables to plot,
followed instructions to make a scatterplot, and put accepted on the Y axis.
But he didn't recognize that information about year was lost in this attempt.
:::
  

**MF**: _Give me several ways this graph could be improved._

Here are several ways the scatterplot could be improved:

  - Add trend line: Include a regression line or smooth curve to better visualize the overall relationship between applicants and accepted students.
  - Annotate data points: Add labels or callouts to highlight specific data points, such as the first and last years.
  - Adjust axis scales: Consider scaling the x-axis logarithmically to better display the wide range of applicant numbers.
  - Color code by year: Use different colors or shapes for the data points to indicate the year, making trends over time more apparent.
  - Include acceptance rate: Represent the acceptance rate using point size, color intensity, or a third axis to provide more context.
  - Consider alternative chart types: Depending on the goal, a bubble chart or small multiples could be more effective for visualizing the full dataset.
  - Provide more context: Add a title, axis labels, and annotations to clearly communicate the meaning and insights from the data.


The specific improvements would depend on the intended purpose and audience for the visualization. The goal is to choose chart types 
and design elements that most effectively convey the key trends and relationships in the data.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: Claude did well here. These are mostly useful suggestions.
:::


**MF**: _Let's say the audience is prospective UNC students and their parents. And the goal is to show whether and how the relationship between applicants and accepted students changes over time. Can you re-draw the scatterplot for this purpose and audience?_

Understood. Here is a scatterplot visualizing the relationship between UNC applicants and accepted students over time, tailored for prospective students and their parents:

```{r UNC-claude8}
ggplot(UNC, aes(x = applicants, y = applicants * rate, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Total Applicants") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Students Accepted") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Year") +
  labs(title = "Trends in UNC Applicants vs. Accepted Students") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"))
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
**Critique**: Ugh! Of Claude's earlier suggested changes, using discrete, unordered
colors for the years is probably the least effective.
:::

## Summarize the conversation

Here I want to ask a meta-question, asking him to summarize our conversation.

**MF**: _Can you give me a brief summary of this conversation, including what you were asked to do and how you tried to answer my questions._

**Claude**: 
 In this conversation, you asked me to:

1. Analyze and describe a graph showing trends in UNC applicants and acceptance rates.
2. Reproduce the graph using R and ggplot, then explore alternative visualizations.
3. Calculate the number of accepted students and create a new graph to show that data.
4. Create a scatterplot of applicants vs. accepted students and suggest ways to improve it.

I provided detailed responses addressing each of your requests. Key points:

- I identified potential issues with the original graph design, such as the use of dual y-axes.
- I recreated the graph in R, then modified it to better display the data.
- I calculated the number of accepted students and created a line chart to visualize that metric.
- For the scatterplot, I suggested adding trend lines, annotating data points, adjusting scales, and considering alternative chart types.

Throughout, I aimed to demonstrate my understanding of data visualization best practices and my ability to generate relevant, accurate, and helpful responses. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

## Discussion

My questions were designed as a sort of [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)
applied to the problem of graph comprehension and construction. For a proper Turing Test, there
should have been another human answering the same questions, but I played that role as well as being
the interrogator. Nevertheless, I'm convinced that Claude failed this test. He would have passed if I judged his performance indistinguishable from that of an advanced undergrad with basic
knowledge of the uses of various graphic forms and ability to code these in R.

When I first looked at the original graph, my initial thought was that the data on admissions
could best be shown in a scatterplot, connecting the points with lines ordered by year.
This entirely avoids the problems with display of two time series with separate Y axes.
I tried to frame questions leading him in this direction, but without asking for something
like this directly.

The direct way to show that, plotting acceptance rate against number of applicants is shown below.
I also added the linear regression fit to support the conclusion stated in the plot title.

```{r UNC-MF1}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(data=UNC,
       aes(x = applicants, y = rate)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill="blue", alpha = 0.1) +
  labs(x="Number of applicants",
       y="Acceptance rate (%)",
       title = "UNC acceptance rates decline as applicants increase") +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = year)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Another idea was that the relationship between number of applicants and number of students _admitted_
was more direct than that with _rates_ of admission. Here is my attempt to capture this
and supply a title for what I saw in this plot.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

UNC <- UNC |>
  mutate(accepted = applicants * rate/100)

ggplot(data=UNC,
       aes(x = applicants, y = accepted)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill="blue", alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(accepted))) +
  labs(x="Number of applicants",
       y="Number accepted",
       title = "UNC admissions increase slowly but not steadily!") +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = year)) +
  scale_x_continuous(label = unit_format(unit = "K", scale = 1e-3, sep = "")) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = unit_format(unit = "K", scale = 1e-3, sep = "")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Both of these graphs show something new: The dip in admissions and admission rate in 2022
compared to other years.

### Prompt engineering

The widespread use of AI chatbots has fueled quite a different approach to interacting with
generative AI agents with the goal of optimizing the quality of the results.
[_Prompt engineering_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) is the term
commonly used for this process, which suggests that the onus is on the human to describe
what is wanted in sufficient detail to yield satisfactory output.
From an initial query, this may lead to a longer more specific
statement of the problem including context, instructions, and references to the conversation history.

The **text-to-text** variety, where the human and AI agent interact in written questions and responses,
was the original domain of Large Language Models, a wide variety of distinct prompt engineering techniques have been studied, largely from an engineering and computer science perspective.
This has suggested useful strategies, such as _Chain of thought_,
to solve a problem as a series of intermediate steps. That is partially the implicit strategy I followed in my conversation with Claude.

In the **text-to-image** version of this problem, the goal is to ask the AI agent 
(such as [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/) or [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home)) to generate an image from a verbal description. Their results are often seen in blog posts, where
a text input might have been something quirky like ["The Pope wearing a puffy jacket"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/03/26/that-viral-image-of-pope-francis-wearing-a-white-puffer-coat-is-totally-fake/), or more prosaic and
focused like "A data analyst looking at two screens trying to decide which data visualization to present at a business meeting."

This has given rise to [detailed tips for generating digital art](https://www.blueshadow.art/midjourney-prompt-commands/) with specialize prompts indicating
various aspects of the main and background content, color schemes, lighting and so forth, as in this example:

```{r cyberpunk, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/midjourney-cyberpunk-prompt.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/midjourney-cyberpunk.png")
```


The present inquiry used several other problem forms, in the context of data visualization:

* **image-to-text**: Upload an image of a data graph. Tell me what you understand from this image.
* **data-to-code and image**: Given data, generate software code to reproduce the image.
* **image-to-image**: Take a given version of a data graphic and re-imagine it in a different graphic form.

There are some tips for such problems, but this domain seems to be largely unstudied in the framework of generative AI and LLMs.

Claude did rather well on some of the basic aspects of these tasks, but failed miserably on anything having to do with really understanding the relationships among variables in my example and how best
to illustrate these in graphic displays. I share responsibility for this with my co-author. Perhaps
we can both learn from this experiment.
